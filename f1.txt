I live only for my scholarship ( about $37 per month). It's really impossible for me to pay for this course. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. I want to take this course as I want to complete the Full Stack Web Development Specialization on Coursera.

I want to complete the AI Specialization on offer by Stanford University. This Specialization will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out AI Skills and specialization and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.

I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
